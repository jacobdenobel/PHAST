# Phenomological Adaptive STochastic auditory nerve fiber model

[![test-python](https://github.com/jacobdenobel/PHAST/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jacobdenobel/PHAST/actions/workflows/test.yml)

This repository contains an archive implentation of a phenomenological auditory nerve fiber model. The model is implemented in C++, with a runtime interface for Python. It can be easily installed via pip:
```bash
pip install phastc
```

The model has been tested and built for python versions 3.6-11, and is compiled using g++ for MacOS and Linux and msvc on Windows.
